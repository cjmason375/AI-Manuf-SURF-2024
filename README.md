## INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

#### *From Everett's Annotated Literature Review:* <br>

"The NSF AI in Manufacturing project seeks to innovate standard industrial processes by incorporating emerging Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices for smart detection. Within this multi-university project, my team is focusing on the use of TinyML in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and using multi-sensor analysis on machines for predictive maintenance and productivity monitoring."

{give context to buzzwords and terms and the high-level background}
As Industry 4.0 emerges across the industrial scene, factories are seeking the use of new technologies to improve the efficiency and economics of manufacturing processes. One such useful technology is the Internet of Things (IoT) and its ability to connect devices and transfer data through the internet. Ongoing research seeks to utilize IoT devices for the implementation of TinyML on machines, which can track machine operation states, track and potentially optimize specific operations, and also detect anomalies in machine behavior. TinyML allows for Machine Learning (ML) to occur directly on machines through small, low-powered devices, improving multiple issues with traditional ML processes such as latency, power consumption, and bandwith issues.

{more speciifc background to the project}
This project is a case study seeking to implement a Machine Learning model on a plasma etching machine at Purdue University's Birck Nanotechnology Center.
