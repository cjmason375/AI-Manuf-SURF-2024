## INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

#### *From Everett's Annotated Literature Review:* <br>

"The NSF AI in Manufacturing project seeks to innovate standard industrial processes by incorporating emerging Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices for smart detection. Within this multi-university project, my team is focusing on the use of TinyML in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and using multi-sensor analysis on machines for predictive maintenance and productivity monitoring."
