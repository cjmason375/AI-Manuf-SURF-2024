## INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

#### *From Everett's [Annotated Literature Review](https://github.com/cjmason375/AI-in-Manuf-SURF-2024/blob/main/Annotated%20Literature%20Review):* <br>

*"The NSF AI in Manufacturing project seeks to innovate standard industrial processes by incorporating emerging Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices for smart detection. Within this multi-university project, my team is focusing on the use of TinyML in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and using multi-sensor analysis on machines for predictive maintenance and productivity monitoring."*

[Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0) is an ongoing shift for factories towards utilizing smart manufacturing means in modern manufacturing processes. This digitalization of the industrial world uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for automated real-time decision-making, optimizing productivity means, and reducing production costs. The [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.oracle.com/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/) has become increasingly important in this field, as IoT devices can connect and transfer data over the internet. 

To effectively implement AI and ML into the industrial scene, collecting and analyzing data is essential for creating accurate and efficient models. For industrial purposes, IIoT encompasses a multitude of sensors and instruments that can be used to collect signifiacant data about machine operation. Some primary data collection fields on machines are electrical consumption, motion/vibration, environment, sound, and vision. This collected data can then be used to train an ML model to track or make decisions based on a machine's operation state, a type of operation that a machine is running, abnormal behavior of the machine. 


(Edge computing) Once a ML model has been created, it is important to implement hte model in a way with which decision-making can be done as quickly as possible

As Industry 4.0 emerges across the industrial scene, factories are seeking the use of new technologies to improve the efficiency and economics of manufacturing processes. One such useful technology is the Internet of Things (IoT) and its ability to connect devices and transfer data through the internet. Ongoing research seeks to utilize IoT devices for the implementation of TinyML on machines, which can track machine operation states, track and potentially optimize specific operations, and also detect anomalies in machine behavior. TinyML allows for Machine Learning (ML) to occur directly on machines through small, low-powered devices, improving multiple issues with traditional ML processes such as latency, power consumption, and bandwith issues.
